Awesome choice! Let’s shape this idea into a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** using **no-code tools**, so you can launch quickly and test your idea with real users.

### 🚀 MVP Blueprint: “Engineering Notes Hub” (Placeholder name — we can brainstorm names too!)

---

### 1. 🧱 **Core Features for MVP**

**Goal:** Let students download/upload notes based on branch → year → subject.

#### Must-Haves for MVP:

- Simple homepage with branch selection
- Dynamic pages for year and subject selection
- Upload and download PDF functionality
- Basic login/signup for upload access
- Notes listed with title, description, and download button

### 2. 🔧 Tools to Build This Without Coding

| Function           | Tool                                                           | Why Use It?                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Website Builder    | **Webflow** / **Dorik** / **Carrd (for ultra-simplicity)**     | Visually flexible, supports dynamic pages   |
| Backend / Database | **Airtable** or **Notion** (linked to Webflow via Zapier/Make) | Easy to manage subjects, branches, notes    |
| File Storage       | **Google Drive** or **Cloudinary**                             | Free and scalable for PDFs                  |
| Upload Forms       | **Tally** or **Typeform** embedded                             | Simple file upload with form                |
| Auth (Login)       | **Memberstack** / **Outseta**                                  | Add login/signup without coding             |
| Automation         | **Zapier** or **Make (Integromat)**                            | To connect upload forms to storage/database |

### 3. 🧩 MVP Page Flow (Live Navigation Structure)

- **Homepage**:  
  ➤ “Choose Your Branch” → 5 buttons  
  ➤ Quick search bar (optional)

- **Branch Page (e.g., Mechanical)**:  
  ➤ “Choose Year” → 1st to 4th

- **Year Page (e.g., 2nd Year)**:  
  ➤ Show subject cards (from Airtable)

- **Subject Page (e.g., Fluid Mechanics)**:  
  ➤ List of notes with:
  - Title
  - Short Description
  - Download button
  - Uploader’s name  
    ➤ “Upload Notes” form embedded

### 4. ⚙️ What to Build First (MVP Sprint Plan – 1 Week)

| Day | Task                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Choose tool (Webflow/Dorik), create homepage                       |
| 2   | Build branching structure (pages by branch → year → subject)       |
| 3   | Set up Airtable with notes database                                |
| 4   | Connect upload form (Tally or Typeform) and storage (Google Drive) |
| 5   | Embed download section with real PDFs                              |
| 6   | Add basic auth (Memberstack or skip for MVP)                       |
| 7   | Test with 3–5 friends and collect feedback                         |

### ✅ Real Example: MVP in Action

Imagine a 2nd-year CSE student lands on your site:

- Selects: **CSE → 2nd Year → Data Structures**
- Sees 3 notes:  
  📄 “Stacks and Queues” by Anjali (4.2★)  
  📄 “Linked Lists Summary” by Ravi
- Uploads a new PDF she made, gets an auto-thank you message
